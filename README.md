## Who is this website for
If you have some data you'd like to visualise...

## Design Decisions

I decided to create a website that would take the user on a journey for uploading a csv file to be able to view it as a chart, rather than just having a chart and expecting that they would automatically know what to do with it.

The site and chart are created with the user in mind using a dark theme which is commonplace for viewing data or technical information where you have to concentrate on the numbers/data.

The interface is created with a clean design with easy to read text, so that the user can concentrate on the task at hand.

- Navigation
- The Chart
- How To
- Features
- Footer

 
## Typography
- FONT (fill in) for the h1, h2 and h3 as a strong, clean, easy to read font.
- FONT (fill in) for the body, modern and easy to read, keeping it clean with the chart


## Color Choices

#### CSS root Selector
**:root Selector - pseudo-class selector**

I used the :root Selector for creating a personalised color set.

## Responsiveness

I created the website using mobile first 

The website has a basic Grid for the main area, and the same grid for the header element so that the content on both doesn't stretch to the far left and right of larger screens, e.g. QHD or 4K monitors.

## Accessibility
- 'alt' text is applied to every image/icon. 

- Contrasting colors.
 	* Easy to see buttons and navigation area.
	


## Consistency
- The fonts match, the header fonts and content (paragraph) fonts.
- The padding is the same or similar for each element across the website
- Text size in rem and box/container padding is in em. 

## Testing


*All tested in Incognito mode.*



### Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools

### Validator Testing
- **HTML**
<https://validator.w3.org/>


- **CSS**
<https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/>



### Manual Testing
*...and how I went about it.*


The web browsers I used in manual testing are Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Opera.

I checked that the responsive design didn't break when changing the aspect ratio (from mobile to QHD)



### Responsive Testing


I used Chrome and Firefox "developer tools, device toggle" to check the responsiveness for each device. From iPhone, roughly 320px, to laptop 1920px, and to the desktop at 2560px (QHD).
